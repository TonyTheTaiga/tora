# Tora Consumer GTM — v0 (Rewritten)

A cohesive go‑to‑market plan for a real‑time, mobile‑first ML tracking app focused on consumers/hobbyists, with a $4.99 paid app and optional Pro add‑ons. Emphasis: frictionless QR onboarding, live alerts, creator‑grade shareables, and integrations where hobby projects live (Colab/Kaggle/RunPod/ComfyUI/Local LLM tooling).

## Market Thesis & Hedge
- Foundation models commoditize “enterprise‑grade” tasks; the last mile shifts to adapters (LoRA), light SFT, prompt/session optimization, and evals.
- Consumers (creators, students, hobbyists) will drive a growing share of training/personalization as on‑device NPUs and low‑precision finetuning (QLoRA/4‑bit) spread.
- Enterprise won’t vanish but will buy capability, not seats for trackers. The consumer wedge is underserved and rising.
- Hedge: Track “sessions” broadly—training + inference + evals—to expand utility beyond pure training.

## Product Thesis
- Smartphones are the default notification/UI surface; builders want live feedback anywhere.
- Enterprise tools overshoot hobby use (heavy UX, seat pricing). There’s a gap for a beautiful, mobile‑native tracker.
- Wedge: live monitoring + social sharing as a creator workflow, not just ops.

## Positioning & Messaging
- One‑liner: “See your training live on your phone.”
- Taglines: “Real‑time ML tracking for indie builders.” “Alerts, charts, and controls—right in your pocket.”
- Social: share cards with deep links and tasteful “Made with Tora” branding.

## Target Users & Contexts
- Indie ML tinkerers: LoRA fine‑tunes, SD/SDXL, merges.
- Students/course takers: small projects needing fast feedback; clean visuals for reports.
- Remote compute users: Colab/Kaggle/RunPod/Modal seeking status + alerts.
- Creators/educators: sharable visuals and public pages.

## Core Use Cases (MVP)
- Live metrics with push alerts (loss spikes, best checkpoint, early‑stop).
- Mobile control surface: pause/resume, mark best, add note/tag.
- Public run pages + shareable cards/GIFs for social and PRs.
- Weekly digest: AI summary of experiments and anomalies.

## Differentiators
- Platform‑native experience: Live Activities, lock‑screen widgets, watch app.
- Frictionless pairing: QR from SDK/CLI; no password wall.
- Creator‑ready visuals: one‑tap export to X/Discord with deep links.
- Consumer model: paid app + optional Pro; no seats.

## Pricing & Packaging
- Base: $4.99 paid app (lifetime core features on‑device, limited cloud).
- Pro (IAP $1.99–$3.99/mo): unlimited sync, longer retention (90–180d), multi‑device, Discord bot, custom themes, watermark off, public pages.
- Free mode (dev builds/TestFlight/Android beta): last 3 runs, 7‑day retention, watermark.
- Students: 50% off Pro; referral: both get 1 month Pro.

## Growth Loops & Channels
- Content engine: “Train X in Y minutes” notebooks with a magic Tora cell + QR link.
- Influencers: YouTube/TikTok AI creators—exclusive templates, rev share, affiliates.
- Communities: r/LocalLLaMA, r/StableDiffusion, r/MachineLearning; Discord bot (free) posting live snapshots.
- Launch pack: Product Hunt + Reddit; starter templates + 7‑day Pro trial.
- University ambassadors: class kits; free instructor Pro.

## Onboarding Flow (Spec)
- CLI/SDK: `pip install tora` → `tora link` prints QR + short code.
- App: scan QR → device token binds to ephemeral key → SDK receives secure device topic for push/events.
- Colab/Kaggle: `tora.link()` displays QR in cell output; short code fallback.
- Security: short‑lived pairing window; revoke devices in app; salted device IDs.

## Distribution Integrations (v0→v1)
- Colab/Kaggle one‑liner cell + QR.
- VS Code/Jupyter extension (sidebar live mirror).
- RunPod/Modal/Replicate/ComfyUI/LM Studio integrations/plugins.
- GitHub Action snippet: post run summary cards to PRs.

## Virality & Retention
- Share cards: auto chart montage with logo + deep link; GIF option.
- Streaks & milestones: “3‑day successful run streak”, “First LoRA best@step”.
- Weekly “Experiment Diary”: highlights, trend lines, anomalies, best models.
- Collaborative view: read‑only live link for mentors/peers (time‑boxed).

## Launch Plan (8–10 Weeks)
- W1–2: Landing page + waitlist, teaser video, TestFlight. Recruit 10–15 creators.
- W3–5: Beta (200–500 users). Finalize pairing, share cards, Discord bot. Iterate ASO.
- W6: Content sprint (5–8 tutorials, sample notebooks, templates).
- W7: Announce date, testimonials, embargoed reviews.
- W8: Launch PH/Reddit/X, creator drops, limited‑time Pro trial, live Discord event.
- Post: weekly template drops, leaderboard challenges, partner integrations.

## Key Metrics
- Activation: QR pair rate; TTFM (time‑to‑first‑metric) < 5 min.
- Engagement: DAU/WAU; sessions per run; alerts interacted.
- Conversion: free → paid app; paid → Pro trial → Pro paid.
- Virality: share card views; referral code usage; public page visits.
- Cost guardrails: infra <$0.02/user/day (batching + retention tiers).

## Risks & Mitigations
- Niche TAM: broaden to “sessions” (training + inference + eval); prioritize SD/LoRA/student communities first.
- Low LTV with one‑time price: Pro IAP, template marketplace rev share, seasonal bundles.
- Infra costs: client aggregation, batch uploads, tiered retention, regioned buckets.
- App Store background limits: rely on push + Live Activities; avoid long‑lived background sockets.
- Colab/Kaggle networking limits: offline cache + delayed upload; printable QR + code fallback.

## Validation Plan (Pre‑Code/Light‑Code)
- Smoke test: landing page with waitlist; aim 15–25% visitor → email.
- Wizard of Oz: demo video of “live run” → collect $4.99 intent + Pro interest.
- Creator pilots: 10 creators use share cards in content; measure CTR.
- Student/hobbyist interviews: uni/ComfyUI/Local LLM discords.
- Green‑light targets: 500 waitlist; 50 TestFlight users with TTFM < 5 min; 30% share a card in week 1.

## Roadmap
- v0: iOS app (live charts, push alerts, QR pairing), SDK logging, public pages, share cards, Discord bot.
- v1: Pro (retention/multi‑device/custom themes), templates marketplace, VS Code/Jupyter extension.
- v2: Lightweight experiment comparisons, evals for LLM/RAG, opt‑in “Explore”, Android.

## 6–12 Month Signals (Falsifiable)
- 5k+ waitlist; 30–40% install‑to‑pair; TTFM < 5 min for 70% of new users.
- 25% of WAU share at least one card; 10% publish public run pages.
- ≥3 integrations adopted (Colab/Kaggle cell, ComfyUI node, VS Code sidebar).
- Marketplace GMV ≥ $3–10k/month by month 6 with ≥10 active creators.

## Viability Verdict (Current View)
- Not foolish. A crisp consumer wedge with real differentiation and growing demand. Success hinges on frictionless QR onboarding, creator‑grade share cards, and integrations where hobbyists live. Broadening to “sessions” ensures daily utility beyond training.
